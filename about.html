              <p>I really enjoy gaming because i like the exploration and problem solving aspects of the games.</p>
              <p>My favourite type of genre is first-player and management type games</p>
              <p>Some example of these games are Witcher 3, Legend of Zelda : Breathe of the Wild & Tears of the Kindgom, Pokemon, Hospital Point, Civilization.. etc </p>
            
            <h3 class="interest-types">Trying out new things</h3>
              <img src="https://exclusive.multibriefs.com/images/exclusive/0222worthatry.jpg" alt="Trying new things"/>
              <p>I know this interest sounds vauge and i comtemplated naming it as traveling but i realised sometimes traveling can be so exhasuting and that takes the joy out of it, so that i don't enjoy alot.</p>
              <p>I guess for me, I am generally a curious person and I am not a fan of 'What if' so i am constantly seeking new expereiences and it could be in my country or within the neightbourhood.</p>
              <p>Just trying things like skydiving, visiting the museum, roadtrips, music festivals, pottery!</p>

            <h3>Creative crafts</h3>

              <p>I've done many things in my life and i realised at my age i am starting to enjoy peaceful activities.</p>
              <p>Right now, at this moment, creative crafts brings me peace, and i really enjoy create things like painting, sewing, drawing etc</p>
              <p>Just something about it brings me alot of serentiy and it gives my brain fuzzy feelings.</p>
