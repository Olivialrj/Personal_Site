          <h2>My Interest:</h2>
          <h3>Gaming</h3>
          <p>i really enjoy gaming because i like the exploration and problem solving aspects of the games.</p>
          <p>My favourite type of genre is first-player and management type games</p>
          <p>Some exmaple of these games are Witcher 3, Legend of Zelda : Breathe of the Wild & Tears of the Kindgom, Pokemon, Hospital Point, Civilization.. etc </p>
          <h3>Trying out new things</h3>
          <p>I know this interest sounds vauge and i comtemplated naming it as traveling but i realised sometimes traveling can be so exhasuting and it takes the joy out of travelling, so that i don't enjoy alot.</p>
          <p>I guess for me, I am generally a curious person and I am not a fan of 'What if' so i am constantly seeking new expereiences and it could be in my country or within the neightbourhood.</p>
          <h3>Creative crafts</h3>
          <p>I've done many things in my life and i realised at my age i am starting to enjoy peaceful activities.</p>
          <p>Right now, at this moment, creative crafts brings me peace, and i really enjoy create things like painting, sewing, drawing etc</p>
          <p>Just something about it brings me alot of serentiy and it gives my brain fuzzy feelings.</p>
